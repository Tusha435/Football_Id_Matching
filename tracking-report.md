# Technical Report: Advanced Player Re-Identification System for Football Video Analysis

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

Player tracking in football videos presents unique challenges due to:
- Similar appearance of players (uniform jerseys)
- Rapid movements and direction changes
- Frequent occlusions during tackles and close encounters
- Camera motion and perspective changes
- Variable lighting conditions

The goal of this system is to maintain consistent player identities throughout a video sequence, enabling tactical analysis and performance metrics.

## 2. Approach and Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

The system employs a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Object Detection** → YOLO-based player detection
2. **Motion Prediction** → Kalman filter for trajectory estimation
3. **Feature Extraction** → Appearance-based descriptors
4. **Data Association** → Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching
5. **Track Management** → Confidence-based lifecycle handling

### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 YOLO-based Detection

The system uses a custom-trained YOLO model (`best2.pt`) with two classes:
- Class 1: Regular players
- Class 2: Goalkeepers

Detection filtering criteria:
- Confidence threshold: > 0.5
- Area constraints: 1000 < area < 15000 pixels
- Aspect ratio: 1.2 < height/width < 4.5
- Minimum dimensions: width > 20px, height > 40px

#### 2.2.2 Kalman Filter for Motion Prediction

**State Vector**: The Kalman filter tracks each player's state as:

```
x = [x_pos, y_pos, v_x, v_y]ᵀ
```

**State Transition Model**:

```
F = | 1  0  1  0 |
    | 0  1  0  1 |
    | 0  0  1  0 |
    | 0  0  0  1 |
```

This represents:
- x(t+1) = x(t) + v_x(t)
- y(t+1) = y(t) + v_y(t)
- v_x(t+1) = v_x(t)
- v_y(t+1) = v_y(t)

**Measurement Model**:

```
H = | 1  0  0  0 |
    | 0  1  0  0 |
```

We only observe position, not velocity.

**Noise Matrices**:
- Measurement noise: R = 10 × I₂
- Process noise: Q = 0.1 × I₄ (with Q[2:4, 2:4] *= 0.01 for velocity)

**Update Equations**:

Prediction step:
```
x̂(k|k-1) = F × x̂(k-1|k-1)
P(k|k-1) = F × P(k-1|k-1) × Fᵀ + Q
```

Update step:
```
K = P(k|k-1) × Hᵀ × (H × P(k|k-1) × Hᵀ + R)⁻¹
x̂(k|k) = x̂(k|k-1) + K × (z(k) - H × x̂(k|k-1))
P(k|k) = (I - K × H) × P(k|k-1)
```

#### 2.2.3 Appearance Features

The system extracts appearance features using HSV color histograms:

1. **Region of Interest**: Upper half of bounding box (jersey area)
2. **Color Space**: HSV for illumination robustness
3. **Feature Vector**: 
   - 8-bin histogram for Hue (0-180°)
   - 8-bin histogram for Saturation (0-255)
   - Total: 16-dimensional feature vector
4. **Normalization**: L2 normalization for scale invariance

Feature similarity is computed using cosine similarity:

```
similarity = (f₁ · f₂) / (||f₁|| × ||f₂||)
```

#### 2.2.4 Assignment Problem - Hungarian Algorithm

The assignment cost matrix C[i,j] between player i and detection j is:

```
C[i,j] = w₁ × C_spatial + w₂ × C_appearance + w₃ × C_size
```

Where:
- w₁ = 0.5 (spatial weight)
- w₂ = 0.3 (appearance weight)  
- w₃ = 0.2 (size consistency weight)

**Spatial Cost**:
```
C_spatial = ||predicted_pos - detected_pos|| / max_movement_per_frame
```

**Appearance Cost**:
```
C_appearance = 1 - cosine_similarity(player_features, detection_features)
```

**Size Cost**:
```
C_size = 1 - min(area₁, area₂) / max(area₁, area₂)
```

The final cost is adjusted by track confidence:
```
C_final = C_total / (track_confidence + 0.1)
```

### 2.3 Spatial-Temporal Constraints

Key constraint: **Players cannot teleport**

Implementation:
- Maximum movement per frame: 30 pixels
- Spatial gate threshold: 50 pixels
- Assignments beyond this threshold get cost = ∞

This prevents ID switches due to detection errors or rapid camera movements.

### 2.4 Track Lifecycle Management

#### Track Confidence Model:

```
confidence(t+1) = {
    min(1.0, confidence(t) × 1.1)     if detected
    confidence(t) × 0.95               if missed
}
```

#### Track States:
1. **Active**: Currently being tracked
2. **Lost**: Temporarily missing (up to max_disappeared frames)
3. **Retired**: Permanently removed

#### Occlusion Handling:

Occlusion detection via Intersection over Union (IoU):
```
IoU = Area(Box₁ ∩ Box₂) / Area(Box₁ ∪ Box₂)
```

If IoU > 0.3, players are marked as occluded.
